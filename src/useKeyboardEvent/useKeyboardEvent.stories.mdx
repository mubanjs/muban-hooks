# useKeyboardEvent

The `useKeyboardEvent` hook uses the [useEventListener](?path=/story/useeventlistener-docs--page) to attach a keyboard event (`keydown`) to a specific
target and triggers a callback when the provided key is pressed.

The default target is the `document`, because local bindings are usually done through the `event`
binding.

But if you ever need to you could still overwrite the event target to something else, it
has support for the following targets:
* `Window`
* `Document`
* `DomElementOrRef` - Meaning all types of Dom elements or Muban Refs

> **Note:** You can use the [useEscapeKeyEvent](?path=/story/useescapekeyevent-docs--page) hook if you want to attach a listener for the `Escape` key

## Reference

```ts
function useKeyboardEvent(
  keys: KeyboardEventKey | Array<KeyboardEventKey>,
  callback: KeyDownCallback,
  target: EventTarget = document,
): void
```

### Parameters

* `keys` – The key(s) that you want to listen for.
* `callback` – The function to invoke when the one of the keys is pressed.
* `target` – The target on which the listener is bound, by default the document.

### Returns

* `void`

## Usage

```ts
useKeyboardEvent(Key.ArrowRight, (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
  console.log('The arrow right is pressed', event.currentTarget);
});
````


```ts
const Demo = defineComponent({
  name: 'demo',
  refs: {
    someRef: 'some-ref'
  },
  setup({ refs }) {

    // The default event is bound to the document
    useKeyboardEvent(Key.ArrowRight, () => console.log('The `ArrowRight` key is pressed.'));

    // You can add multiple keys to your listener, either through the `ts-key-enum` or a `string`
    useKeyboardEvent([Key.ArrowLeft, 'a'], () => console.log('The `ArrowLeft` or `a` key was pressed.'));

    // You can even overwrite the default target to something else if you don't want the document.
    useEventListener(Key.ArrowUp, () => console.log('The `ArrowUp` is pressed.'), refs.someRef);

    return [];
  }
})
```
