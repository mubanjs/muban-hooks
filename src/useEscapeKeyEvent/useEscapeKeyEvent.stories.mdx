# useEscapeKeyEvent

The `useEscapeKeyEvent` hook is is a preset for the [useKeyboardEvent](?path=/story/usekeyboardevent-docs--page) hook, it is probably one of
the most common use cases for adding keyboard events to your application.

When building applications that use some sort of overlay or dropdown it's common courtesy to implement
some sort of functionality that allows you to close it through pressing the `Escape` key on your keyboard.

This helps in making your site feel more intuitive and accessibility friendly, see a more detailed
description about this on the [W3.org page](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#keyboard-interaction-7).
